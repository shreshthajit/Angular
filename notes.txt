custom event handling:
1.we have made two buttons in the cockpit component and each of them has a event.
so if we want to inform about this two button in the app component we can use Eventemitter with a output decorator.And this will update
the data in the app component everytime we click the button on cockpit component.
The app component will handle an array and we can use that array using a event handller in the app component.https://www.messenger.com/t/100013764522302/
